# PESI_Q1

1)	Assumed that passing a null should throw an exception
2)	The first implementation uses System.Random and has O(n) time complexity. I am not aware what C# uses to generate random numbers but my guess is that they are not purely random.
3)	For second implementation, I did not want to code an algo that is, on purpose, slower than the first one and then state that the first implantation is faster. Instead, I just chose to implement my own random number generator. For random number generation seed value, I wanted to use something more hardware based, that is perhaps truly random, such as heat generated by CPU, but I doubt we have software access to such things. As such, I implemented a basic random number generator for this second implementation.
